Liberty is a cloud-optimized Java runtime that is fast to start up with a low memory footprint and a dev mode for quick iteration. Adding and removing features to adopt the latest open cloud-native Java API like MicroProfile and Jakarta EE are easy with Liberty. Liberty's zero migration lets you focus on what's important and not the APIs changing under you.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build...

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed before starting the module of Presisting Data.
For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].
You'll build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Getting started with Liberty and REST

Liberty now has an easy way to get started using the Open Liberty Starter. This tool provides a simple and quick way to get the necessary files to start building an application on Open Liberty. Through this tool you can specify your application and project name, choose a build tool from either Maven or Gradle, and pick which version of Java SE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile your application will use.

In this workshop, we will use the Open Liberty Starter to create the start of our application. We will use Maven as our selected build tool and will use Java SE version 17, Jakarta EE 9 and MicroProfile version 5.

To get started with this tool, visit the Getting Started page:
https://openliberty.io/start/[https://openliberty.io/start/^]

Once there, we must now enter the properties needed for our application.

Under Group specify:
`io.openliberty.deepdive`

Under Artifact specify:
`liberty-deepdive-inventory`

Under Build Tool select:
`Maven`

Under Java SE Version select:
`17`

Under Java EE/Jakarta EE Version select:
`9`

Under MicroProfile Version select:
`5`

Then select the `Generate Project` Button.
This will download the starter project as a .zip file. 

Next, unpackage the .zip file on your machine.
Move the contents of this unzipped file to within the start directory of this project.


=== Building the application:

This application is configured to be built with Maven. Every Maven-configured project contains a `pom.xml` file, which defines the project configuration, dependencies, plug-ins, and so on.

Your pom.xml file is located in the `start/liberty-deepdive-inventory` directory and is configured to include the [hotspot=libertyMavenPlugin]`liberty-maven-plugin`, which allows you to install applications into Open Liberty and manage the server instances.

To begin, open a command line session and navigate to the instaled application directory. 

[role='command']
```
cd start/liberty-deepdive-inventory
```

Build the system microservice that is provided and deploy it to Open Liberty by running the Maven liberty:run goal:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

The `mvn` command initiates a Maven build, during which the target directory is created to store all build-related files.

The `liberty:run` argument specifies the Open Liberty `run` goal, which
starts an Open Liberty server instance in the foreground.
As part of this phase, an Open Liberty server runtime is downloaded and installed into
the `target/liberty/wlp` directory, a server instance is created and configured in the
`target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer` directory, and the application is
installed into that server via https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_loose_applications.html[loose config^].

For more information about the Liberty Maven plug-in, see its https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven[GitHub repository^].

When the server begins starting up, various messages display in your command-line session. Wait
for the following message, which indicates that the server startup is complete:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKF0011I: The server defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

When you need to stop the server, press `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where
you ran the server, or run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `start` directory in
another command-line session:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop
```


=== Starting and stopping the Open Liberty server in the background

Although you can start and stop the server in the foreground by using the Maven
`liberty:run` goal, you can also start and stop the server in the background with
the Maven `liberty:start` and `liberty:stop` goals:

[role='command']
----
mvn liberty:start
mvn liberty:stop
----


=== Updating the server configuration without restarting the server

The Open Liberty Maven plug-in includes a `dev` goal that listens for any changes in the project, 
including application source code or configuration. The Open Liberty server automatically reloads the configuration without restarting. This goal allows for quicker turnarounds and an improved developer experience.

Stop the Open Liberty server if it is running, and start it in dev mode by running the `liberty:dev` goal in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

Dev mode automatically picks up changes that you make to your application and allows you to run tests by pressing the `enter/return` key in the active command-line session. When youâ€™re working on your application, rather than rerunning Maven commands, press the `enter/return` key to verify your change.



=== Developing a RESTful microservice

----

The [hotspot=path file=0]`@Path` annotation on the class indicates that this resource responds to the `/systems` path in the JAX-RS application. The [hotspot=applicationPath file=1]`@ApplicationPath` annotation in the [hotspot=RestApplication file=1]`RestApplication` class together with the [hotspot=path file=0]`@Path` annotation in this class indicates that the resource is available at the `/api/systems` path.

JAX-RS maps the HTTP methods on the URL to the methods of the class by using annotations. 
Your application uses the [hotspot=get]`GET` annotation to map an HTTP `GET` request
to the `/api/systems` path.

The [hotspot=get file=0]`@GET` annotation on the method indicates that this method is to be called for the HTTP `GET` method. The [hotspot=produces file=0]`@Produces` annotation indicates the format of the content that will be returned. The value of the [hotspot=produces file=0]`@Produces` annotation will be specified in the HTTP `Content-Type` response header. For this application, a JSON structure is to be returned. The desired `Content-Type` for a JSON response is `application/json` with `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` instead of the `String` content type. Using a constant such as `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` is better because if there's a spelling error, a compile failure occurs.

JAX-RS supports a number of ways to marshal JSON. The JAX-RS 2.1 specification mandates JSON-Binding (JSON-B). The method body returns the result of `inventory.getSystems()`. Since the method is annotated with `@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)`, JAX-RS uses JSON-B to automatically convert the returned object to JSON data in the HTTP response.


=== Running the application:

Because you started the Open Liberty server in dev mode at the beginning of the guide, all the changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the http://localhost:9080/api/systems URL.


== Documenting APIs

Next, we'll see how to document and filter RESTful APIs from annotations, POJOs (Plain old Java objects), and static OpenAPI files by using MicroProfile OpenAPI.

The OpenAPI specification, previously known as the Swagger specification, defines a standard interface for documenting and exposing RESTful APIs. This specification allows both humans and computers to understand or process the functionalities of services without requiring direct access to underlying source code or documentation. The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification provides a set of Java interfaces and programming models that allow Java developers to natively produce OpenAPI v3 documents from their JAX-RS applications.

The MicroProfile OpenAPI API is included in the MicroProfile dependency that is specified in your `pom.xml` file. Look for the dependency with the `microprofile` artifact ID. This dependency provides a library that allows you to use the MicroProfile OpenAPI API. The `microProfile-5.0` feature is also enabled in the `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file.

=== Generating the OpenAPI document for the inventory service

You can generate an OpenAPI document in various ways. First, because all JAX-RS annotations are processed by default, you can augment your existing JAX-RS annotations with OpenAPI annotations to enrich your APIs with a minimal amount of work. Second, you can use a set of predefined models to manually create all elements of the OpenAPI tree. Finally, you can filter various elements of the OpenAPI tree, changing them to your liking or removing them entirely.


==== Generating the Open API document

Because the JAX-RS framework handles basic API generation for JAX-RS annotations, a skeleton OpenAPI tree will be generated from the inventory service. You can use this tree as a starting point and augment it with annotations and code to produce a complete OpenAPI document.

Now, visit the http://localhost:9080/openapi URL to see the generated OpenAPI tree. You can also visit the http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui URL for a more interactive view of the APIs.


=== Augmenting the existing JAX-RS annotations with OpenAPI annotations

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `SystemResources` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/deepdive/rest/SystemResource.java`
----

Add OpenAPI [hotspot=APIResponse file=0]`@APIResponse`, [hotspot=APIResponseSchema file=1]`@APIResponseSchema`, [hotspot=Operation file=1]`@Operation`, and [hotspot=Parameter file=1]`@Parameter` annotations to the two JAX-RS methods, [hotspot=getsystem hotspot=Parameter file=1]`getSystem()` and [hotspot=listContents file=1]`listContents()`.


Clearly, there are many more OpenAPI annotations now, so letâ€™s break them down:

[cols="35, 200", options="header"]
|===
| *Annotation*    | *Description*
| [hotspot=APIResponse file=0]`@APIResponse`  | Describes a single response from an API operation.
| [hotspot=APIResponseSchema file=0]`@APIResponseSchema` | Convenient short-hand way to specify a simple response with a Java class that could otherwise be specified using @APIResponse.
| [hotspot=Operation file=0]`@Operation`    | Describes a single API operation on a path.
| [hotspot=Parameter file=0]`@Parameter`    | Describes a single operation parameter.
|===


Since the Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide, your changes were automatically picked up.
Refresh the http://localhost:9080/openapi URL to see the updated OpenAPI tree. 
The two endpoints at which your JAX-RS methods are served are now more meaningful:

[source, YAML, role="no_copy"]
----
/inventory/systems:
  get:
    summary: List inventory contents.
    description: Returns the currently stored host:properties pairs in the inventory.
    responses:
      "200":
        description: host:properties pairs stored in the inventory.
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/InventoryList'
/inventory/systems/{hostname}:
  get:
    summary: Get JVM system properties for particular host
    description: Retrieves and returns the JVM system properties from the system
      service running on the particular host.
    parameters:
    - name: hostname
      in: path
      description: The host for whom to retrieve the JVM system properties for.
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
      example: foo
    responses:
      "404":
        description: Missing description
        content:
          application/json: {}
      "200":
        description: JVM system properties of a particular host.
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
----


OpenAPI annotations can also be added to POJOs to describe what they represent. 
Currently, your OpenAPI document doesn't have a very meaningful description of the 
[hotspot=InventoryClass file=1]`Inventory` POJO and hence it's very difficult to tell 
exactly what that POJO is used for. 
To describe the [hotspot=InventoryClass file=2]`Inventory` POJO in more detail, 
augment the [hotspot file=2]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/deepdive/rest/Inventory.java` 
file with some OpenAPI annotations.

Add OpenAPI [hotspot=Inventory hotspot=Systems file=2]`@Schema` annotations to 
the [hotspot=Inventory file=2]`Inventory` class and the [hotspot=Systems file=1]`systems` variable.

[role='code_command hotspot file=2', subs="quotes"]

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/module-openapi/src/main/java/io/openliberty/deepdive/rest/Inventory.java[]
----

Likewise, annotate the [hotspot file=3]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/SystemData.java` POJO, which is referenced in the [hotspot file=2]`Inventory` class.

Add OpenAPI [hotspot=SystemData hotspot=Hostname hotspot=Properties file=2]`@Schema` annotations 
to the [hotspot=SystemData file=2]`SystemData` class, 
the [hotspot=Hostname file=2]`hostname` variable and the [hotspot=Properties file=2]`properties` variable.

==  Configuring the microservice

Next, we'll look at how we can externalize and inject both static and dynamic configuration properties for microservices using MicroProfile Config.

The MicroProfile Config API is included in the MicroProfile dependency that is specified in your `pom.xml` file. Look for the dependency with the `microprofile` artifact ID. This dependency provides a library that allows you to use the MicroProfile Config API to externalize configurations for your microservices. The `microProfile-5.0` feature is also enabled in the `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file.




Gilbert's instructions:
add the configuration for the port and/or context root on the server.xml and pom.xml
run the application with different scenario
change server.xml
change pom.xml
change by env var
add mp-config to the app
add follow to SystemResource class
@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "client.https.port")
String CLIENT_PORT;
add endpoint POST /inventory/api/systems/client/{hostname} but only do System.out.println for the CLIENT_PORT value
full
create microprofile-config.properties file
run the application with changing CLIENT_PORT by env var

== Persisting data

use JPA to access and persist data to a database for the microservice

== Securing RESTful APIs

secure the RESTful APIs

== Consuming the secured RESTful APIs by JWT

use JWT/jwtSso to consume/call the secured RESTful APIsÂ 

== Adding health checks

use MicroProfile Health to report the health status of the microservice

== Providing metrics

use MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics from the microservice

== Testing the microservice

use test containger to test the microservice

== Building the containerÂ 

develop the microservice under container environment

package the microservice

build a container for the microservice

== Deploying the microservice to Kubernetes

install Open Liberty operator to Kubernetes

deploy the microservice to Kubernetes

== Support Licensing

use WebSphere Liberty


== Great work! You're done!

You just learnt to build a microservice in Open Liberty!
