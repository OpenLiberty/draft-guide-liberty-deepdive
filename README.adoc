view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Liberty is a cloud-optimized Java runtime that is fast to start up with a low memory footprint and a dev mode for quick iteration. Adding and removing features to adopt the latest open cloud-native Java API like MicroProfile and Jakarta EE are easy with Liberty. Liberty's zero migration lets you focus on what's important and not the APIs changing under you.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build...

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed before starting the module of Presisting Data.
For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].
You'll build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Getting started with Liberty and REST

Liberty now has an easy way to get started using the Open Liberty Starter. This tool provides a simple and quick way to get the necessary files to start building an application on Open Liberty. Through this tool you can specify your application and project name, choose a build tool from either Maven or Gradle, and pick which version of Java SE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile your application will use.

In this workshop, we will use the Open Liberty Starter to create the start of our application. We will use Maven as our selected build tool and will use Java SE version 17, Jakarta EE 9 and MicroProfile version 5.

To get started with this tool, visit the Getting Started page:
https://openliberty.io/start/[https://openliberty.io/start/^]

Once there, we must now enter the properties needed for our application.

Under Group specify:
`io.openliberty.deep.dive`

Under Artifact specify:
`liberty-deepdive-inventory`

Under Build Tool select:
`Maven`

Under Java SE Version select:
`17`

Under Java EE/Jakarta EE Version select:
`9`

Under MicroProfile Version select:
`5`

Then select the `Generate Project` Button.
This will download the starter project as a .zip file. 

Next, unpackage the .zip file on your machine.
Move the contents of this unzipped file to within the start directory of this project.


=== Building the application:

This application is configured to be built with Maven. Every Maven-configured project contains a `pom.xml` file, which defines the project configuration, dependencies, plug-ins, and so on.

Your pom.xml file is located in the `start/liberty-deepdive-inventory` directory and is configured to include the [hotspot=libertyMavenPlugin]`liberty-maven-plugin`, which allows you to install applications into Open Liberty and manage the server instances.

To begin, open a command line session and navigate to the instaled application directory. 

[role='command']
```
cd start/liberty-deepdive-inventory
```

Build the system microservice that is provided and deploy it to Open Liberty by running the Maven liberty:run goal:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

The `mvn` command initiates a Maven build, during which the target directory is created to store all build-related files.

The `liberty:run` argument specifies the Open Liberty `run` goal, which
starts an Open Liberty server instance in the foreground.
As part of this phase, an Open Liberty server runtime is downloaded and installed into
the `target/liberty/wlp` directory, a server instance is created and configured in the
`target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer` directory, and the application is
installed into that server via https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_loose_applications.html[loose config^].

For more information about the Liberty Maven plug-in, see its https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven[GitHub repository^].

When the server begins starting up, various messages display in your command-line session. Wait
for the following message, which indicates that the server startup is complete:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKF0011I: The server defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

When you need to stop the server, press `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where
you ran the server, or run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `start` directory in
another command-line session:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop
```


== Starting and stopping the Open Liberty server in the background

Although you can start and stop the server in the foreground by using the Maven
`liberty:run` goal, you can also start and stop the server in the background with
the Maven `liberty:start` and `liberty:stop` goals:

[role='command']
----
mvn liberty:start
mvn liberty:stop
----


== Updating the server configuration without restarting the server

The Open Liberty Maven plug-in includes a `dev` goal that listens for any changes in the project, 
including application source code or configuration. The Open Liberty server automatically reloads the configuration without restarting. This goal allows for quicker turnarounds and an improved developer experience.

Stop the Open Liberty server if it is running, and start it in dev mode by running the `liberty:dev` goal in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

Dev mode automatically picks up changes that you make to your application and allows you to run tests by pressing the `enter/return` key in the active command-line session. When youâ€™re working on your application, rather than rerunning Maven commands, press the `enter/return` key to verify your change.

The [hotspot=path file=0]`@Path` annotation on the class indicates that this resource responds to the `/systems` path in the JAX-RS application. The [hotspot=applicationPath file=1]`@ApplicationPath` annotation in the [hotspot=RestApplication file=1]`RestApplication` class together with the [hotspot=path file=0]`@Path` annotation in this class indicates that the resource is available at the `/api/systems` path.

JAX-RS maps the HTTP methods on the URL to the methods of the class by using annotations. 
Your application uses the [hotspot=get]`GET` annotation to map an HTTP `GET` request
to the `/api/systems` path.

The [hotspot=get file=0]`@GET` annotation on the method indicates that this method is to be called for the HTTP `GET` method. The [hotspot=produces file=0]`@Produces` annotation indicates the format of the content that will be returned. The value of the [hotspot=produces file=0]`@Produces` annotation will be specified in the HTTP `Content-Type` response header. For this application, a JSON structure is to be returned. The desired `Content-Type` for a JSON response is `application/json` with `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` instead of the `String` content type. Using a constant such as `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` is better because if there's a spelling error, a compile failure occurs.

JAX-RS supports a number of ways to marshal JSON. The JAX-RS 2.1 specification mandates JSON-Binding (JSON-B). The method body returns the result of `inventory.getSystems()`. Since the method is annotated with `@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)`, JAX-RS uses JSON-B to automatically convert the returned object to JSON data in the HTTP response.


=== Running the application:

Because you started the Open Liberty server in dev mode at the beginning of the guide, all the changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the http://localhost:9080/api/systems URL.


== Documenting APIs

Next, we'll see how to document and filter RESTful APIs from annotations, POJOs, and static OpenAPI files by using MicroProfile OpenAPI.

The OpenAPI specification, previously known as the Swagger specification, defines a standard interface for documenting and exposing RESTful APIs. This specification allows both humans and computers to understand or process the functionalities of services without requiring direct access to underlying source code or documentation. The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification provides a set of Java interfaces and programming models that allow Java developers to natively produce OpenAPI v3 documents from their JAX-RS applications.

Before you proceed, note that the 1.0 version of the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does not define how the /openapi endpoint may be partitioned in the event of multiple JAX-RS applications running on the same server. In other words, you must stick to one JAX-RS application per server instance as the behaviour for handling multiple applications is currently undefined

=== Generating the OpenAPI document for the inventory service

You can generate an OpenAPI document in various ways. First, because all JAX-RS annotations are processed by default, you can augment your existing JAX-RS annotations with OpenAPI annotations to enrich your APIs with a minimal amount of work. Second, you can use a set of predefined models to manually create all elements of the OpenAPI tree. Finally, you can filter various elements of the OpenAPI tree, changing them to your liking or removing them entirely.

Because the JAX-RS framework handles basic API generation for JAX-RS annotations, a skeleton OpenAPI tree will be generated from the inventory service. You can use this tree as a starting point and augment it with annotations and code to produce a complete OpenAPI document.

Now, visit the http://localhost:9080/openapi URL to see the generated OpenAPI tree. You can also visit the http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui URL for a more interactive view of the APIs.

=== Augmenting the existing JAX-RS annotations with OpenAPI annotations

Because all JAX-RS annotations are processed by default, you can augment the existing code with OpenAPI annotations without needing to rewrite portions of the OpenAPI document that are already covered by the JAX-RS framework.

[hotspot=host-property hotspot=Parameter file=0]`getPropertiesForHost()` and [hotspot=listContents file=0]`listContents()`.

Clearly, there are many more OpenAPI annotations now, so letâ€™s break them down:

[cols="35, 200", options="header"]
|===
| *Annotation*    | *Description*
| [hotspot=APIResponse file=0]`@APIResponse`  | Describes a single response from an API operation.
| [hotspot=APIResponseSchema file=0]`@APIResponseSchema` | Convenient short-hand way to specify a simple response with a Java class that could otherwise be specified using @APIResponse.
| [hotspot=Operation file=0]`@Operation`    | Describes a single API operation on a path.
| [hotspot=Parameter file=0]`@Parameter`    | Describes a single operation parameter.

OpenAPI annotations can also be added to POJOs to describe what they represent. 
Currently, your OpenAPI document doesn't have a very meaningful description of the 
[hotspot=InventoryListClass file=1]`InventoryList` POJO and hence it's very difficult to tell 
exactly what that POJO is used for. 
To describe the [hotspot=InventoryListClass file=1]`InventoryList` POJO in more detail, 
augment the [hotspot file=1]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/InventoryList.java` 
file with some OpenAPI annotations.

=== Filtering the OpenAPI tree elements

Filtering of certain elements and fields of the generated OpenAPI document can be done by using the
`OASFilter` interface.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryOASFilter` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/filter/InventoryOASFilter.java`
----
InventoryOASFilter.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/filter/InventoryOASFilter.java[]
----

The [hotspot=filterAPIResponse file=0]`filterAPIResponse()` method allows filtering of `APIResponse` elements. When you
override this method, it will be called once for every `APIResponse` element in the OpenAPI tree.
In this case, you are matching the `404` response that is returned by the `/inventory/systems/{hostname}`
endpoint and setting the previously missing description. To remove an `APIResponse` element
or another filterable element, simply return `null`.

The [hotspot=filterOpenAPI file=0]`filterOpenAPI()` method allows filtering of the singleton [hotspot=OpenAPI file=0]`OpenAPI` element. 
Unlike other filter methods, when you override [hotspot=filterOpenAPI file=0]`filterOpenAPI()`, 
it is called only once as the last method for a particular filter. 
Hence, make sure that it doesn't override any other filter operations that are called before it. 
Your current OpenAPI document doesn't provide much information on the application itself or on what server and port it runs on. 
This information is usually provided in the `info` and `servers` elements, which are currently missing. 
Use the `OASFactory` class to manually set these and other elements of the OpenAPI tree from the `org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.models`
package. The [hotspot=OpenAPI file=0]`OpenAPI` element is the only element that cannot be removed, because that would mean
removing the whole OpenAPI tree.

Each filtering method is called once for each corresponding element in the model tree. You can think
of each method as a callback for various key OpenAPI elements.

Before you can use the filter class that you created, you need to create the [hotspot file=1]`microprofile-config.properties` file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the configuration file.#
`src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----
microprofile-config.properties
[source, text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=Scan']
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

This configuration file is picked up automatically by MicroProfile Config and registers your filter
by passing in the fully qualified name of the filter class into the [hotspot=Config file=1]`mp.openapi.filter` property.

// =================================================================================================
// Pre-generated APIs
// =================================================================================================

== Using pregenerated OpenAPI documents

As an alternative to generating the OpenAPI model tree from code, you can provide a valid pregenerated
OpenAPI document to describe your APIs. This document must be named `openapi` with a `yml`, `yaml`, or `json`
extension and be placed under the `META-INF` directory. Depending on the scenario, the document
might be fully or partially complete. If the document is fully complete, then you can disable
annotation scanning entirely by setting the `mp.openapi.scan.disable` MicroProfile Config property to `true`.
If the document is partially complete, then you can augment it with code.

To use the pre-generated OpenAPI document, create the OpenAPI document YAML file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the OpenAPI document file.#
`src/main/webapp/META-INF/openapi.yaml`
----


openapi.yaml
[source, text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/openapi.yaml[]
----

This document is the same as your current OpenAPI document with extra APIs for the `/inventory/properties` endpoint. 
Since this document is complete, you can also add the [hotspot=Scan file=1]`mp.openapi.scan.disable` property
and set it to `true` in the [hotspot file=1]`src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file.
