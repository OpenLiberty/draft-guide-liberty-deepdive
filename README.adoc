Liberty is a cloud-optimized Java runtime that is fast to start up with a low memory footprint and a dev mode for quick iteration. Adding and removing features to adopt the latest open cloud-native Java API like MicroProfile and Jakarta EE are easy with Liberty. Liberty's zero migration lets you focus on what's important and not the APIs changing under you.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build...

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed before starting the module of Presisting Data.
For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^].
You'll build and run the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

== Getting started

Create a maven project by OL starter.

Develop an RESTful microservice.

== Documenting APIs

Document the RESTful APIs by using MicroProfile OpenAPI

==  Configuring the microservice

configure the context root and port

provide external configuration to the microservice using MicroProfile Config

== Persisting data

use JPA to access and persist data to a database for the microservice

== Securing RESTful APIs

Now you will secure your RESTful APIs.

Begin by adding some users and user groups to your `server.xml` Liberty configuration file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

// File 0
server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/module-securing/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=basicregistry file=0]`basicRegistry` contains a list of all users for the application and their passwords, as well as all of the user groups. The [hotspot=myadmins file=0]`myAdmins` group tells the application which of the users are in the administrator group, and the [hotspot=myusers file=0]`myUsers` group tells the application which users are in the user group.

The `security-role` maps the [hotspot=adminrole file=0]`admin` role to the [hotspot=myadmins file=0]`myAdmins` group, meaning that all users in the `myAdmins` group will have the administrator role. Similarly, the [hotspot=userrole file=0]`user` role is mapped to the [hotspot=myusers file=0]`myUsers` group, meaning all users in the `myUsers` group will have the user role.

Your application will have the following users and passwords:

[cols="<35, ^200, ^200"]
|===
| *Username* | *Password* | *Role*
| bob | bobpwd | admin, user
| alice | alicepwd | user
|===

The [hotspot=keystore file=0]`keyStore` is a repository of security certificates used for SSL encryption. The `id` is a unique configuration id, which is set to `defaultKeyStore`, and the `password` is used to load the keystore file. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form.

Now you will secure the `inventory` service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `SystemResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/deepdive/rest/SystemResource.java`
----

// File 1
SystemResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/module-securing/src/main/java/io/openliberty/deepdive/rest/SystemResource.java[]
----

This class now has role-based access control. The role names that are used in the [hotspot=put hotspot=delete file=1]`@RolesAllowed` annotations are mapped to group names in the groups claim of the JSON Web Token (JWT), which results in an authorization decision wherever the security constraint is applied.

The [hotspot=putEndpoint file=1]`/{hostname}` endpoint annotated with the [hotspot=put file=1]`@PUT` annotation updates a system in the inventory. This `PUT` endpoint is annotated with the [hotspot=putRolesAllowed file=1]`@RolesAllowed({ "admin", "user" })` annotation. Only authenticated users with the role of `admin` or `user` can access this endpoint.

The [hotspot=deleteEndpoint file=1]`/{hostname}` endpoint annotated with the [hotspot=delete file=1]`@DELETE` annotation removes a system from the inventory. This `DELETE` endpoint is annotated with the [hotspot=deleteRolesAllowed file=1]`@RolesAllowed({ "admin" })` annotation. Here, only authenticated users with the role of `admin` can access this endpoint.

You can manually check that the `inventory` service is secure by making requests to each of the endpoints.

Before we do this, we must add a system to the inventory.
Try adding a system via the `POST` endpoint `/systems` using the following command:

[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/inventory/api/systems -d 'hostname=localhost&osName=mac&javaVersion=11&heapSize=1'
----

You should expect the following response:

[source role=no_copy]
----
{ "ok" : "localhost was added." }
----

This calls the `/systems` endpoint and adds a new system `localhost` to the inventory.
We can validate that this has worked by calling the `/systems` endpoint with a `GET` request to retrieve all the systems in the inventory, with the following curl command:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:9080/inventory/api/systems
----

You should now expect the following response:

[source, role=no_copy]
----
[{"heapSize":1,"hostname":"localhost","javaVersion":"11","osName":"mac"}]
----

Now we will try calling our secure `PUT` endpoint to update the system we just added, with the following curl command:

[source]
----
curl -k --user alice:alicepwd -X PUT https://localhost:9443/inventory/api/systems/localhost -d 'osName=mac&javaVersion=17&heapSize=2'
----

As this endpoint is accessible to the groups `user` and `admin` we have logged in with `user` credentials and updated the system.

You should see the following response:

[source, role=no_copy]
----
{ "ok" : "localhost was updated." }
----

This means that you have successfully logged in as an authenticated `user`, and that the endpoint works as expected.

Now try calling the `DELETE` endpoint. As this endpoint is only accessible to `admin` users, we should expect this to fail if we attempt to access it with a user in the `user` group.

We can check that our application is secured against these requests with the following command:

[source]
----
curl -k --user alice:alicepwd -X DELETE https://localhost:9443/inventory/api/systems/localhost
----

As `alice` is part of the `user` group, this request should not work. In your dev mode console, you should expect the following output:

[source, role=no_copy]
----
jakarta.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: Unauthorized
----

Now we will attempt to call this endpoint with an authenticated `admin` user, which should work correctly.
Enter the following curl command:

[source]
----
curl -k --user bob:bobpwd -X DELETE  https://localhost:9443/inventory/api/systems/localhost
----

You should see the following response:

[source, role=no_copy]
----
{ "ok" : "localhost was removed." }
----

This means that your endpoint is secure. Validate that it works correctly by calling the `/systems` endpoint with the following curl command:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:9080/inventory/api/systems
----

You should see the following output:

[source, role=no_copy]
----
[]
----

This shows that the endpoints work as expected and that the system you added has been successfully deleted.

== Consuming the secured RESTful APIs by JWT

use JWT/jwtSso to consume/call the secured RESTful APIs 

== Adding health checks

use MicroProfile Health to report the health status of the microservice

== Providing metrics

use MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics from the microservice

== Testing the microservice

use test containger to test the microservice

== Building the container 

develop the microservice under container environment

package the microservice

build a container for the microservice

== Deploying the microservice to Kubernetes

install Open Liberty operator to Kubernetes

deploy the microservice to Kubernetes

== Support Licensing

use WebSphere Liberty


== Great work! You're done!

You just learnt to build a microservice in Open Liberty!
